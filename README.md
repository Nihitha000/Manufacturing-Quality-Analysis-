# Manufacturing-Quality-Analysis-
The manufacturing quality analysis project is a comprehensive examination aimed at enhancing product quality within the parts manufacturing industry. Leveraging data-driven methodologies and predictive modeling, this project addresses the challenges posed by inconsistencies in product dimensions, which contribute to defects and consumer dissatisfaction.
With our data prepped, we moved on to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This was a crucial step to understand the characteristics of our data. We visualized distributions, checked for correlations, and explored relationships between variables. These insights laid the foundation for our subsequent modeling.
The reason why Random Forest Regression was selected for our manufacturing dataset due to its versatility in handling both numerical and categorical variables, and its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships, making it well-suited for the diverse nature of manufacturing data.
Now, let's talk about the exciting part â€“ model training! We chose the Random Forest Regressor as our machine learning algorithm. After fitting the model to our training data, we evaluated its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE). This metric quantifies the accuracy of our predictions. The lower the MSE, the better our model aligns with actual values.
Visualizing our results was key to interpreting the model's performance. We created scatter plots to compare actual versus predicted values and delved into feature importance. This helped us understand which features played a crucial role in our model's decision-making process.
In conclusion, our Random Forest Regressor demonstrated strong predictive capabilities, showcasing accurate forecasts for manufacturing dimensions. Our iterative approach ensures continuous improvement, setting the stage for ongoing optimization and reliable manufacturing quality predictions.
